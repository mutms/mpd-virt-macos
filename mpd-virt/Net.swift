// The in-VM container network, as seen from the Mac. Reaching a VM's
// containers means one static route plus one scoped resolver file — no
// tunnel involved.
//
// ── Per-VM addressing ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every fact here is a function of the VM's octet, because every fact in
// the VM is too. VM 222 serves `10.163.222.0/24` with its resolver on
// `10.163.222.1` and owns the DNS zone `222.mpd.test`; VM 150 serves
// `10.163.150.0/24` / `10.163.150.1` / `150.mpd.test`.
//
// That is what lets several VMs be reachable at once. The Mac holds one
// route and one `/etc/resolver/<id>.mpd.test` file per VM, and they do
// not collide: the routes are to disjoint /24s, and macOS resolver(5)
// picks by longest suffix match, so each zone file governs only its own
// VM.
//
// The in-VM half of this lives in `Mpd.Net` (mpd repo, `mpd/Net.swift`).
// The two must agree; they are separate repos, so a change here is a
// change there.
//
// Mirrors the layout mpd uses inside the VM: the host part of an address
// never moves, only the third octet varies, and it always equals the VM
// ID.
//
// Everything this Mac talks to is at `.1`, the podman bridge gateway —
// which is the VM itself, not a container. mpd runs the resolver and the
// TLS frontdoor there as systemd units. They used to be containers on
// `.3` and `.4`; both moved onto the VM, and `.3`/`.4`/`.5` are now
// unassigned. A Mac still pointing at `.3` gets no answer at all: the
// address is simply unused, so lookups fail rather than resolve wrongly.
