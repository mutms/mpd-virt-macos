// mpd-virt — Bootstrap orchestration over SSH.
//
// Drives the mpd/bootstrap/{10..60}-*.sh pipeline against a Debian
// Trixie VM. The bootstrap scripts themselves live in the sibling
// `mpd` repo and are idempotent; this file just sequences them via
// SSH, pushes the host-generated WG/CA material into the VM at the
// right moments, and handles the SSH-drop-and-reconnect dance that
// `30-networking.sh` triggers when it pins the static IP.
//
// Flow against a freshly-prepared VM (whatever its initial IP):
//
//   on initial-ip:
//     10-passwordless-sudo.sh   — wget'd; interactive (-t)
//     20-git-clone.sh           — wget'd; clones to /opt/mpd
//     push server.conf          → /var/lib/mpd/conf/wireguard/mpd0.conf
//     push CA cert              → /var/lib/mpd/conf/caroot/rootCA.pem
//     30-networking.sh <NNN>    — local; SSH session drops here
//
//   on new-ip (10.211.55.<NNN>):
//     waitUntilReachable
//     40-install-software.sh    — local
//     50-build.sh               — local
//     60-wireguard.sh           — local; brings up wg-quick@mpd0
//     mpd --setup               — initializes the in-VM mpd platform
//
// Output of each step is streamed live to the user's terminal.
